InstaTake
===================

InstaTake is a bunch of javascript code that allows you to download pictures from Instagram.
It was available (for few hours, actually) on [instatake.com](http://www.instatake.com) but Instagram didn't like it :(

Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

**But**...

Since it's pure js, you can download and run on your own PC. No server side required!

It simply uses:

* [YQL](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) to interface with an open Instagram endpoint
* [JSZip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) to create and manage zip files
* [FileSaver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) to allow you save the zip from your browser
* A [cors proxy](https://github.com/gr2m/CORS-Proxy) to allow cross-domain ajax calls

Please, don't ask me to put it online again. Just download and enjoy it.

If you wanna take a look to what I do for job [download one of my games](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mangatar.dengen) ;)
